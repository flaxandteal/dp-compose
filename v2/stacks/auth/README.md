# Auth Stack

This stack deploys the necessary services and dependencies to work with the auth stack.

The auth stack uses the sandbox cognito instance to store users and their permissions.

## Getting secrets

To run this stack you will need to obtain the relevant secrets for the .env file, which **must not be committed**:

```sh
# get from AWS > Cognito > User Pools > sandbox-florence-users > user pool ID
AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
# get from AWS > Cognito > User Pools > sandbox-florence-users > App Integration > App clients > dp-identity-api > client id
AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID
# get from AWS > Cognito > User Pools > sandbox-florence-users > App Integration > App clients > dp-identity-api > client secret
AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET

# Below values from the aws login-dashboard or via `aws sts get-session-token`
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

# This should be your locally generated token by Zebedee
SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN

# You'll also need your zebedee root for content
zebedee_root
```

To get the aws values from the dashboard do the following:

- login to the AWS [console](https://ons.awsapps.com/start#/)
- click on `Command line or programmatic access`
- click on `Option 1: Set AWS environment variables (Short-term credentials)`
- copy the highlighted values

Note that the AWS_SESSION_TOKEN is only valid for 12 hours. Once the token has expired you would need to stop the stack, retrieve and set new credentials before running the stack again.

## Run the stack

```sh
make start-detached
```

You should now be able to log in to Florence via your sandbox credentials at localhost:8081/florence/login

When you're done, clean down the environment:

```sh
make clean
```
